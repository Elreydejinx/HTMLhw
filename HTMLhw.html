    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>
   1. 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
   <br>
   2. 3/4 cup granulated sugar
   <br>
   3. 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
   <br>
   4. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
   <br>
   5. 2 large eggs
   <br>
   6. 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
   <br>
   7. 1 teaspoon baking soda
   <br>
   8. 1/2 teaspoon salt
   <br>
   9. 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
   <br>
   10. 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
</p>
<h4>Steps:</h4>

    <p>
    1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
    <br>
    2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
    <br>
    3. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
    <br>
    4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
    <br>
    5. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
    <br>
    6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
    <br>
    7. Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
    <br>
    8. Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
